#### Hello?  

You've shared the rules for creating *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks*. I'm ready to assist you with code changes. Please share the files you'd like me to edit or describe the changes you'd like to make, and I'll follow these rules to propose the necessary edits.

#### Act as an expert Python Quantitative Developer and Algorithmic Trading Architect.   
#### We are building a Cryptocurrency Statistical Arbitrage (Pairs Trading) bot for Binance.  
####   
#### ### Tech Stack & Rules:  
#### - Python 3.10+ managed via `poetry`.  
#### - Libraries: `ccxt` (exchange interactions), `pandas` (data manipulation and math), `python-dotenv` (secrets management).  
#### - Strict Rule 1: ALL code comments, docstrings, and log messages MUST be in English.  
#### - Strict Rule 2: NEVER hardcode API keys. Always use `os.getenv` via `python-dotenv`.  
#### - Strict Rule 3: Write production-grade code. Include robust `try-except` blocks, especially for network calls and API requests.  
#### - Strict Rule 4: Use the `logging` module to output to both the console and a `logs/trading.log` file.  
####   
#### ### Current Architecture (Context):  
#### - `config.py`: Loads variables from `.env`.  
#### - `exchange.py`: Contains `BinanceClient` using `ccxt`. Currently has `get_usdt_balance()`.  
#### - `strategy.py`: Will contain the math logic.  
#### - `main.py`: The entry point and orchestrator.  
####   
#### ### Tasks to Execute:  
####   
#### 1. Update `exchange.py`:  
####    - Add a method `fetch_ohlcv_data(symbol, timeframe, limit)` returning a Pandas DataFrame with columns: `['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']`. Ensure the timestamp is converted to a readable datetime format.  
####    - Add a method `place_market_order(symbol, side, amount)` to execute trades. Wrap it in strict try-except blocks handling `ccxt.InsufficientFunds` and `ccxt.NetworkError`.  
####   
#### 2. Implement `strategy.py`:  
####    - Create a class `PairsTradingStrategy`.  
####    - Implement a method `calculate_z_score(df_asset1, df_asset2, window_size)`. It should calculate the price ratio (spread) between Asset 1 (e.g., BTC/USDT) and Asset 2 (e.g., ETH/USDT), then calculate the rolling mean, rolling standard deviation, and finally the Z-score of the spread.  
####    - Implement a method `generate_signal(z_score, upper_threshold=2.0, lower_threshold=-2.0)` returning actionable signals (e.g., 'SHORT_SPREAD', 'LONG_SPREAD', 'FLAT').  
####   
#### 3. Update `main.py` (The Orchestrator):  
####    - Set up file-based logging to `logs/trading.log`.  
####    - Create a continuous loop (e.g., `while True:` with a `time.sleep(60)` at the end) that:  
####      a) Fetches the latest OHLCV data for BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT.  
####      b) Passes the data to `PairsTradingStrategy`.  
####      c) Logs the current Z-score.  
####      d) If a signal is triggered, calculates the order size (hardcode a safe test amount, e.g., $15 worth of crypto, while checking if `get_usdt_balance()` has enough funds).  
####      e) Executes the mock or real trades via `exchange.py`.  
####   
#### Please implement these changes step-by-step, ensuring the code is modular, readable, and PEP 8 compliant. Do not execute real trades yet; if possible, add a `MOCK_TRADING=True` flag in `config.py` to only log the intended trades instead of hitting the actual order API during testing.

To implement the changes, we need to modify `exchange.py`, create `strategy.py`, and update `main.py`. However, since you haven't shared these files yet, I'll describe the changes and then ask you to add the files to the chat.

Here are the steps to implement the changes:

1. Update `exchange.py`:
   - Add a method `fetch_ohlcv_data(symbol, timeframe, limit)` returning a Pandas DataFrame with columns: `['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', 'volume']`.
   - Add a method `place_market_order(symbol, side, amount)` to execute trades.

2. Implement `strategy.py`:
   - Create a class `PairsTradingStrategy`.
   - Implement a method `calculate_z_score(df_asset1, df_asset2, window_size)`.
   - Implement a method `generate_signal(z_score, upper_threshold=2.0, lower_threshold=-2.0)`.

3. Update `main.py`:
   - Set up file-based logging to `logs/trading.log`.
   - Create a continuous loop that fetches the latest OHLCV data for BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT, passes the data to `PairsTradingStrategy`, logs the current Z-score, and executes trades if a signal is triggered.

Please add the `exchange.py`, `strategy.py`, and `main.py` files to the chat, and I'll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks* for the changes. 

Also, I'll need to create a new file `config.py` to add the `MOCK_TRADING=True` flag. 

After you add the files, I'll provide the code changes in *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks*. 

Please add the files to the chat. 

Once you've added the files, I can assist you further. 

You can add the files one by one, and I'll provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE blocks* for each file. 

Please go ahead and add the first file. 

If you need to create a new file, I can provide the code in a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with an empty `SEARCH` section. 

Let me know when you're ready to add the files. 

I'll be happy to assist you with the code changes. 

Please add the files to the chat, and I'll get started.
